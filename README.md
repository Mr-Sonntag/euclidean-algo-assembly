# euclidean-algo-assembly

This is a final project for one of my CS classes towards my A.S. Computer Science degree.

This program is written in assembly and showcases the use of the Euclidean Algorithm. The program asks the user for two integer inputs in which it will determine the largest and smallest of the two to then compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two with the use of the Euclidean Algorithm. 

The Euclidean Algorithm is the process of dividing a smaller integer from the larger one to figure out the remainder. If the remainder is not zero, than the original divisor is the new largest number while the remainder is now the divisor. This continues until a remainder of zero is achieved, in which the previous divisor is the GCD of the original two numbers.

This program demonstrates knowledge of algorithmic concepts, core programming techniques, documentation, computer hardware & cpu architecture, user interaction, and more.
